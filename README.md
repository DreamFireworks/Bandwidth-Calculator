# Bandwidth-Calculator
Hello,

# In MB version (mb-bandwidthCalc.py) :
  Asks user to enter the File's size in MegaBytes in first Entry.
  And then asks user to enter the Download Speed in MegaBits.
  Finally it calculates the time in seconds, minutes and hours, and shows the result in the bottom.

## Formula for calculation:(MB)
(Megabytes) / (Download Speed In Megabits / 8) = Time In Seconds

# In GB version (mb-bandwidthCalc.py) :
  Asks user to enter the File's size in GigaBytes in first Entry.
  And then asks user to enter the Download Speed in MegaBits.
  Finally it calculates the time in seconds, minutes and hours, and shows the result in the bottom.

## Formula for calculation:(GB)
(Gigabytes*1024) / (Download Speed In Megabits / 8) = Time In Seconds


## Future plan: 
Merge two program into one.
